        <p class="project-details">I realized that when I went to <a class="underline" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> I would scan the page and click on titles I found interesting that also had a lot of comments, because to me that signaled that the content itself generates discussion, rather than the number of votes, which signals an attention-grabbing title. I built a Twitter bot to scrape the front page of Hacker News and tweet out any stories that have at least 70 comments. I now go to Scraper News instead of Hacker News because it condenses the information down to the most talked about articles, plus I can catch up on days I missed.</p>
        <p class="project-details">This was built in python, using the <a class="underline" href="http://scrapy.org/" target="_blank">Scrapy</a> and <a class="underline" href="https://twython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">Twython</a> libraries, and is hosted on this server through <a class="underline" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>. The scraper runs every 15 minutes with a cron job.</p>

        <p class="project-details">In high school I spent a lot of time on a now defunct tee design forum (<a class="underline" href="http://www.emptees.com/" target="_blank">Emptees</a> and saw that many designers were either using poorly made or expensive shirt mockups. I decided to make my own high quality mockups with pictures I took, and sold them through an online marketplace. I have enjoyed a small, consistent stream of orders each month that over the last several years has resulted in a nice amount of extra money (that I now throw away on Ubers). Recently I have begun to accept custom mockup orders, where I create a mockup based on a client's own photography for their personal or commercial use.</p>
        <p class="project-details">These were made in Photoshop, with pictures taken way back before iPhone cameras were good.</p>
